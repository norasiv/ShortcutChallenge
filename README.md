# ShortcutChallenge
Because of a very busy week with my bachelor project i have only been able to work on this here and there, so it has been a week since my first commit but i have not gone over 16 hours.


## Comic Viewer App
Swift with UIkit. I used iPhone 14 pro for the simulator. 

I picked out 5 features to implement in my app:
1. Browse through the comics
    * You can either get a random comic or go to next/previous comic

2. See the comic details, including its description
    * You can see all the fields from the API when you click on the Details-button

3. Search for comics by the comic number as well as text,
    * You can search by comic numbers between 1 - 2765 
    * The xkcd search seemed to be down, every time i tried it in browser i got an error so i didnt try to use it

4. Get the comic explanation
    * You can click on the explanation-button and it will take you to the website with the same comic

5. Favorite the comics, which would be available offline too
    * You can favorite comics, this is done with core data
    * The comic images are done with a hotlink so they will not be available offline

I also have a viewController with info about licensing.
